# Visualizing and Filtering Data on UFOs Sightings 
Data related to UFOs sightings was organized into a HTML page that can facilitate data analysis by taking users' input and returning filtered data.

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a html page that gathers data about UFO sightings and facilitate data analysis. The HTML page contains a form that takes users' input to filter data for multiple criteria at the same time. The data can be filtered by the date, city, state and country of the UFO sightings as well as for the shape of the UFOs. Based on the users input, a filtered data table is returned.

### Resources
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Results
As seen below, the HTML page built contains a data table with 7 columns (date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments) and 111 rows.

The data table can be filtered by 5 of the 7 columns. That is, the data can be filtered by the date, city, state and country of the UFO sightings as well as for the shape of the UFOs. Following is how the HTML looks like when filtered by the column state, value "ca" for the state of California.

More than one filter can be applied at the same time. Here is an example of how the data table can be filter for both state ("ca") and shape ("formation").

## Summary
In sum, the HTML page built in the present project facilitates the visualization of UFOs sightings data. Analysis of the UFOs data can be further facilitated by the addition of a descriptive table in the HTML page. The descriptive table could include summary information about the UFOs sightings. For instance, the table could include how many UFO sightings were observed in total and for a apecific country.
